# oh-come-on
Simple ptrace-based golang `compile` process wrapper removing the annoying `declared and not used` errors at runtime.

Does not touch disk nor modifies go sources. No rebuild of go compiler required.

Tested with [go 1.24.1](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/go/). Other versions are currently unlikely to work.

## build
`make`
